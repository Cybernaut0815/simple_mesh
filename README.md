# simple_mesh
SimpleMesh is a workflow that aims to create a clean model from a scanned/AI generated one. The model is rationalized and parsed using custom scripts and AI segmentation workflows. The resulting model is a NURBS Rhino model that can then be taken into Revit. For the AI segmentation we used Meta's SAM 2 and Scene script.

Developed during the AECTech London Hackathon 2025 by Christoph Geiger, Thomas Lindemann, Rene Dobre, Jose Andres Amenabar and Alex Nap.
